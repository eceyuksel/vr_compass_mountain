He asked: "" I point to the building, not the sign? I answered the front door of the building. ""Do I stay in this location at all times?"" I answered: it does not matter if you see the building or not, you should have an idea about where it is. He looks at the compass during pointing, not much though, sometimes. ",Batty House

Walking not very similar to the method I showed him. He leans on the ring much more, like flying. So, he is very fast in walking.

I guess that is why he was very fast in answering the SBSOD questionnaire. He was very slow so I told him to lean forward more. Still very slow on the first route. ,Golledge Hall

He was looking around in the start of the second route and I told him to turn around and he was like yeah, I am looking around. He asked some random questions likke ""Can you see what I am seeing?

He asked if he should be able to read the small sign on the Snow church. He stops and studyies the buildings at the end of the route. He reported that he used the compas to learn the environment. I asked him how he used it. He said he used the compass the look at which way he is facing and then he used this information to understand how the buildings are located. He also mentioned that the connecting routes helped him. ",Batty House
